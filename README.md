   The code examples provided in this documentation are written for Python 3.x.

Getting Started
---------------

Distancia is designed to be simple and intuitive, yet powerful and flexible. Whether you are working with numerical data, strings, or other types of data, Distancia provides the tools you need to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between objects.


For a quick introduction, check out the :doc:`quickstart` guide. If you want to dive straight into the code, head over to the :doc:`Euclidean` page.


   If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute! See the :doc:`contributing` section for more details.

Installation
------------

To install distancia, simply use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install distancia

For more detailed instructions and additional options, see the :doc:`installation` section.

Quickstart
----------

Here are some common examples of how to use distancia:



   from distancia import Euclidean
   
   point1 = [1, 2, 3]
   
   point2 = [4, 5, 6]
   
   euclidean = Euclidean()
   
   distance = euclidean.calculate(point1, point2)
   
   print(f"Euclidean Distance: {distance}")


   >>>Euclidean Distance: 5.196152422706632


   from distancia import Levenshtein

   string1 = "kitten"
   string2 = "sitting"

   distance = Levenshtein().calculate(string1, string2)
   print(f"Levenshtein Distance: {distance}")


   >>>Levenshtein Distance: 3

Overview
--------
The distancia package offers a comprehensive set of tools for computing and analyzing distances and similarities between data points. This package is particularly useful for tasks in data analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Below is an overview of the key classes included in the package, each designed to address specific types of distance or similarity calculations.



   BatchDistance
-----------------
Purpose: Facilitates batch processing of distance computations, enabling users to compute distances for large sets of pairs in a single operation.

Use Case: Essential in real-time systems or when working with large datasets where efficiency is critical. Batch processing saves time and computational resources by handling multiple distance computations in one go.



   ComprehensiveBenchmarking
----------------------------
Purpose: Provides tools for benchmarking the performance of various distance metrics on different types of data.

Use Case: Useful in performance-sensitive applications where choosing the optimal metric can greatly impact computational efficiency and accuracy. This class helps users make informed decisions about which distance metric to use for their specific task.


   CustomDistanceFunction
--------------------------
Purpose: Allows users to define custom distance functions by specifying a mathematical formula or providing a custom Python function.

Use Case: Useful for researchers or practitioners who need a specific metric that isnâ€™t commonly used or already implemented.


   DistanceMatrix
-----------------
Purpose: Automatically generates a distance matrix for a set of data points using a specified distance metric.

Use Case: Useful in clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, or in generating heatmaps for visualizing similarity/dissimilarity in datasets.



   DistanceMetricLearning
---------------------------
Purpose: Implements algorithms for learning an optimal distance metric from data based on a specific task, such as classification or clustering.

Use Case: Critical in machine learning tasks where the goal is to optimize a distance metric for maximum task-specific performance, improving the accuracy of models.


   IntegratedDistance
---------------------

Purpose: Enables seamless integration of distance computations with popular data science libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy.

Use Case: This class enhances the usability of the distancia package, allowing users to incorporate distance calculations directly into their existing data analysis workflows.



   MetricFinder
----------------


Purpose: Identifies the most appropriate distance metric for two given data points based on their structure.

Use Case: Useful when dealing with various types of data, this class helps users automatically determine the best distance metric to apply, ensuring that the metric chosen is suitable for the data's characteristics.



   OutlierDetection
-------------------

Purpose: Implements methods for detecting outliers in datasets by using distance metrics to identify points that deviate significantly from others.

Use Case: Essential in fields such as fraud detection, quality control, and data cleaning, where identifying and managing outliers is crucial for maintaining data integrity.



   ParallelandDistributedComputation
------------------------------------

Purpose: Adds support for parallel or distributed computation of distances, particularly useful for large datasets.

Use Case: In big data scenarios, calculating distances between millions of data points can be computationally expensive. This class significantly reduces computation time by parallelizing these calculations across multiple processors or machines.



   Visualization
----------------

Purpose: Provides tools for visualizing distance matrices, dendrograms (for hierarchical clustering), and 2D/3D representations of data points based on distance metrics.

Use Case: Visualization is a powerful tool in exploratory data analysis (EDA), helping users understand the relationships between data points. This class is particularly useful for creating visual aids like heatmaps or dendrograms to better interpret the data.
