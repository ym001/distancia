## **distancia** - A Comprehensive Distance Metrics Package for Python

distancia is a Python package that provides an extensive collection of distance metrics and similarity measures, making it easy to calculate and compare the proximity between various types of data. Whether you're working with strings, vectors, or other data types, distancia offers the tools you need for your analysis.

**Features**

Diverse Range of Metrics: Calculate distances using a variety of algorithms including Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine Similarity, Hamming, Jaccard, Levenshtein, and many more.
Ease of Use: Simple and intuitive API design, making it easy to integrate into your existing projects.
Customizable: Easily extend the package with your own custom distance metrics.
Well-Documented: Each function is well-documented, providing clear explanations and examples of use.

**Installation**

You can install distancia via pip:
[distancia on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/distancia/)


bash

```bash

pip install distancia
```

**Usage**

Below are some examples of how to use the distancia package to calculate various distance metrics.

**Example 1:** Calculating Euclidean Distance

```python

from distancia import Euclidean

point1 = [1, 2, 3]
point2 = [4, 5, 6]

distance = Euclidean().distance(point1, point2)
print(f"Euclidean Distance: {distance}")
```

**Example 2: Calculating Cosine Similarity**

```python
from distancia import Cosine_Similarity

vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]

similarity = Cosine_Similarity().distance(vector1, vector2)
print(f"Cosine Similarity: {similarity}")
```

**Example 3: Calculating Levenshtein Distance**

```python
from distancia import Levenshtein

string1 = "kitten"
string2 = "sitting"

distance = Levenshtein().distance(string1, string2)
print(f"Levenshtein Distance: {distance}")
```
