Comparing Random Walk Stationary Distributions
==============================================

Introduction
============

The ``ComparingRandomWalkStationaryDistributions`` class is a Python implementation for comparing the stationary distributions of random walks on graphs. This class provides methods to compute and compare stationary distributions, perform random walks, and analyze the characteristics of these walks on different graph structures.

Understanding Graph Distances
=============================

In the context of graph theory and network analysis, the concept of "distance" between graphs is crucial for understanding structural similarities and differences. The ``Distance`` class focuses on one particular aspect: the behavior of random walks on these graphs.

A random walk on a graph is a stochastic process where a walker moves from node to node along the edges of the graph, choosing the next node randomly from the set of neighbors of the current node. The stationary distribution of a random walk represents the long-term probability of finding the walker at each node, assuming the walk continues indefinitely.

Formal Definition of Distance Metrics
=====================================

The ``Comparing Random Walk Stationary Distributions`` class implements three distance metrics for comparing stationary distributions:

1. L1 Distance (Manhattan Distance):

   .. math::

      d_{L1}(P, Q) = \sum_{i} |P_i - Q_i|

2. L2 Distance (Euclidean Distance):

   .. math::

      d_{L2}(P, Q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i} (P_i - Q_i)^2}

3. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence:

   .. math::

      D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{i} P_i \log(\frac{P_i}{Q_i})

Where :math:`P` and :math:`Q` are the stationary distributions of the two graphs being compared.

Key Features
============

1. Computation of stationary distributions
2. Comparison of stationary distributions using multiple distance metrics
3. Simulation of random walks on graphs
4. Analysis of random walk characteristics (average length, node visit frequencies)

Usage Example
=============

Here's a basic example of how to use the ``Distance`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    from distancia import ComparingRandomWalkStationaryDistributions  

    # Cr√©ation de deux graphes d'exemple
    graph1 = Graph(directed=False, weighted=True)
    graph1.add_edge("A", "B", 1.0)
    graph1.add_edge("B", "C", 2.0)
    graph1.add_edge("C", "A", 1.5)
    
    graph2 = Graph(directed=False, weighted=True)
    graph2.add_edge("A", "B", 2.0)
    graph2.add_edge("B", "C", 1.0)
    graph2.add_edge("C", "D", 1.0)
    graph2.add_edge("D", "E", 1.0)
    
    distance, dist1, dist2 = ComparingRandomWalkStationaryDistributions().compute(graph1, graph2)
    print(f"Distance L1: {distance}")
    print(f"Distribution stationnaire graphe 1: {dist1}")
    print(f"Distribution stationnaire graphe 2: {dist2}")

Output

.. code-block:: bash

   Distance L1: 0.7999999999999999
   Distribution stationnaire graphe 1: {'B': 0.3333333333333333, 'C': 0.3333333333333333, 'A': 0.3333333333333333, 'E': 0.0, 'D': 0.0}
   Distribution stationnaire graphe 2: {'E': 0.2, 'D': 0.2, 'B': 0.2, 'C': 0.2, 'A': 0.2}

Conclusion
==========

The ``Distance`` class provides a powerful tool for comparing graphs based on the behavior of random walks. By analyzing the stationary distributions and characteristics of random walks, researchers and data scientists can gain insights into the structural similarities and differences between graphs. This approach has applications in various fields, including network analysis, community detection, and machine learning on graph-structured data.

Future work could involve extending the class to handle directed and weighted graphs, implementing more sophisticated distance metrics, or integrating this functionality into larger graph analysis frameworks.
