ControlFlowGraph: Measuring Distance Between Control Flow Graphs
===============================================================

Introduction
------------

The **ControlFlowGraph** class is a Python-based tool designed to compare the control flow graphs (CFGs) of two executables or structured files. This comparison measures the structural differences in program logic or file structure, offering insights into how two programs or files diverge in their logical execution paths. By analyzing CFGs, this class provides a robust method for evaluating program similarity, debugging, or detecting malicious code changes.

Sense of the Formula
--------------------

The distance measurement between two CFGs quantifies the structural dissimilarity of their nodes and edges. A CFG represents the flow of control within a program, where:

- **Nodes** correspond to basic blocks or statements.
- **Edges** represent transitions based on conditions or execution paths.

The distance metric captures differences in:
- The number of nodes and edges.
- The connectivity between nodes.
- The presence of unique structures, such as loops or decision points.

This approach is particularly useful for understanding logical variations between files, such as different implementations of the same algorithm or modifications introduced during software evolution.

Formal Definition
-----------------

Let \( G_1 = (V_1, E_1) \) and \( G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \) represent the control flow graphs of two files, where \( V \) denotes nodes and \( E \) denotes edges. The distance \( d(G_1, G_2) \) is formally defined as:

\[
d(G_1, G_2) = \alpha \cdot |V_1 \setminus V_2| + \beta \cdot |E_1 \setminus E_2| + \gamma \cdot f(V_1, V_2)
\]

Where:
- \( |V_1 \setminus V_2| \): Number of unique nodes in \( G_1 \).
- \( |E_1 \setminus E_2| \): Number of unique edges in \( G_1 \).
- \( f(V_1, V_2) \): A function capturing structural differences (e.g., graph edit distance).
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \): Weighting factors for each component.

Complexity
----------

The computational complexity of comparing two CFGs depends on:
- **Node Matching:** Comparing all nodes between two graphs has a complexity of \( O(|V_1| \cdot |V_2|) \).
- **Edge Matching:** Comparing edges has a complexity of \( O(|E_1| + |E_2|) \).
- **Structural Analysis:** Calculating graph edit distance is generally NP-hard but can be approximated using heuristics.

In practice, optimizations such as pruning irrelevant subgraphs or using hashing techniques can reduce runtime for large graphs.
