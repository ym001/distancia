===========================================================

Introduction
------------

Poisson Loss represents a specialized probabilistic distance measure designed specifically for modeling count-based time series data. This sophisticated metric provides a robust mechanism for analyzing and quantifying probabilistic variations in scenarios involving discrete, non-negative integer observations such as event frequencies, occurrence counts, and discrete time series measurements.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Poisson Loss methodology distinguishes itself through:

- Direct modeling of count-based probabilistic distributions
- Precise handling of discrete, non-negative integer data
- Alignment with the Poisson probability distribution's fundamental principles
- Comprehensive representation of rare event occurrences

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For predicted count Î» and actual observed count k, Poisson Loss is mathematically defined as:

.. math::

   L_{Poisson}(\lambda, k) = \lambda - k \log(\lambda) + \log(k!)

Where:

- :math:`\lambda` represents the predicted expected count
- :math:`k` represents the actual observed count
- :math:`\log()` denotes the natural logarithm

Key Mathematical Characteristics
