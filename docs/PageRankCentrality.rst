PageRank Centrality in Distancia
==================================

Introduction
-----------
The ``PageRank`` class implements a sophisticated probabilistic algorithm for measuring node importance in networks. Originally developed by Google to rank web pages, this method has become a fundamental technique for understanding node significance across various network types, from social networks to citation graphs.

Conceptual Framework
------------------
PageRank operates on the fundamental principle that a node's importance is determined by both its direct connections and the importance of nodes linking to it. The algorithm models a random walk through the network, where:

- Nodes represent network entities
- Edges represent connections or influence paths
- Importance is recursively defined through network structure
- A damping factor prevents infinite accumulation of importance

Formal Definition
---------------
The PageRank score Ï€(v) for a node v is defined mathematically as:

.. math::

    \pi(v) = (1-d) + d \sum_{u \in N^{in}(v)} \frac{\pi(u)}{|N^{out}(u)|}

where:
- d is the damping factor (typically 0.85)
- N^{in}(v) represents nodes linking to v
- N^{out}(u) represents nodes linked from u
- (1-d) ensures a baseline importance for all nodes

Matrix formulation:

.. math::

    \pi = (1-d)\mathbf{1} + d\mathbf{P}^T\pi

where P is the column-stochastic transition probability matrix.

Implementation
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from distancia import PageRank

    # Initialize calculator
    pr_calculator = PageRank()

    # Example directed graph
    graph = {
        'A': {'B', 'C'},
        'B': {'C'},
        'C': {'A'},
        'D': {'C'}
    }

    # Calculate PageRank
    scores = pr_calculator.calculate(
        graph, 
        damping_factor=0.85, 
        max_iterations=100, 
        convergence_threshold=1e-8
    )

Complexity Analysis
-----------------
Computational characteristics:

* Time Complexity: O(|E| * k)
  - |E|: Number of edges
  - k: Number of iterations to convergence
  - Typically k << |V|

* Space Complexity: O(|V|)
  - Linear with number of nodes
  - Efficient memory utilization

* Iterative Method: Power iteration
* Convergence: Guaranteed for strongly connected graphs

Special Considerations
---------------------
1. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Damping factor (d) typically 0.85
   - Small variations can significantly impact results
   - Requires careful calibration

2. **Network Properties**:
   - Works best in strongly connected graphs
   - Handles directed and weighted networks
   - Adaptive to different network topologies

3. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Handles small graphs and massive networks
