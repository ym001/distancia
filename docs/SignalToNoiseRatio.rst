SignalToNoiseRatio
===================

Introduction
------------
The **SignalToNoiseRatio** (SNR) is a measure used to quantify the level of a signal relative to the background noise. It is a widely used metric in fields such as telecommunications, audio processing, and image analysis, to assess the quality of a signal or a system.

Sense of the Distance
---------------------
The Signal-to-Noise Ratio indicates how much stronger the signal is compared to the noise. A higher SNR means that the signal is clearer and less affected by noise, making it a crucial metric in evaluating the fidelity of a transmission or recording.

Formal Representation
----------------------
The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is defined as:
\[
SNR = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} \right)
\]
where \( P_{signal} \) is the power of the signal, and \( P_{noise} \) is the power of the noise. This formula expresses the ratio in decibels (dB).

Conclusion
----------
The **SignalToNoiseRatio** class is essential for measuring the clarity and quality of signals in various domains, offering a direct evaluation of how much noise affects the desired signal.
