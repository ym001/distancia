CliqueBasedGraph Class
======================

Introduction
------------

The **CliqueBasedGraph** class implements a distance metric designed to compare two matrices by analyzing the cliques in their corresponding graph representations. Cliques, which are complete subgraphs, serve as fundamental building blocks in graph theory and provide meaningful insights into the structural properties of the graphs.

This approach leverages clique similarity to measure how two matrices differ in terms of their graph-theoretical representations, making it particularly suited for network analysis and structural comparisons.

Utility
-------

The **CliqueBasedGraph** distance has diverse applications, including:

- **Social Network Analysis**: Measuring structural similarities between networks by comparing their cliques.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing protein-protein interaction networks or gene co-expression networks, where cliques often represent functional modules.
- **Graph Clustering and Community Detection**: Evaluating the similarity between clusterings of nodes in large graphs.
- **Infrastructure and Communication Networks**: Comparing topologies of networks based on the presence of tightly connected subgroups.

By focusing on cliques, this metric captures both local and global structural similarities between matrices.

Formal Definition
-----------------

Given two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the **CliqueBasedGraph** distance is computed as follows:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   Convert each matrix \( A \) and \( B \) into their corresponding graph representations \( G_A \) and \( G_B \). For instance:
   - For adjacency matrices, each non-zero entry \( A[i][j] \) corresponds to an edge in \( G_A \).
   - For weighted matrices, consider edges with weights above a certain threshold.

2. **Clique Enumeration**:
   Identify the set of cliques \( C(G_A) \) and \( C(G_B) \) in graphs \( G_A \) and \( G_B \), respectively. Cliques can be extracted using algorithms such as the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.

3. **Clique Similarity**:
   Define the similarity between two sets of cliques based on their sizes and overlaps:
   \[
   S(C(G_A), C(G_B)) = \frac{|C(G_A) \cap C(G_B)|}{|C(G_A) \cup C(G_B)|}
   \]
   where \( |C(G)| \) denotes the number of cliques in graph \( G \).

4. **Distance Metric**:
   The **CliqueBasedGraph** distance is computed as:
   \[
   d_{\text{CliqueBasedGraph}}(A, B) = 1 - S(C(G_A), C(G_B))
   \]
   This metric ranges between 0 (identical cliques) and 1 (completely disjoint cliques).

Academic Reference
-------------------

The **CliqueBasedGraph** distance is inspired by research into graph similarity and clique detection. Notable references include:

Bron, C., & Kerbosch, J. (1973). *Algorithm 457: Finding all cliques of an undirected graph*. Communications of the ACM, 16(9), 575-577.  
This work provides the foundational algorithm for clique detection, which underpins this metric.

Conclusion
----------

The **CliqueBasedGraph** distance provides a robust framework for comparing matrices through their graph-theoretical properties. By focusing on cliques, it captures meaningful structural similarities and differences that are often overlooked by traditional numerical metrics. Its applicability to network analysis, bioinformatics, and graph clustering makes it a versatile tool in various domains.
