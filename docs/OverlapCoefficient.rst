OverlapCoefficient
===================

Introduction
------------
**OverlapCoefficient** is a similarity measure used to compare two sets, typically representing the unique words or terms in two documents. The overlap coefficient captures the ratio of the common elements between two sets relative to the size of the smaller set. It is particularly useful when comparing two documents to evaluate how much they share in terms of content.

Distance Meaning
----------------
The **OverlapCoefficient** measures the degree of overlap between two sets. In the context of text, it measures how much the smaller set (of terms or words) is contained within the larger set. This makes it a normalized similarity measure where a perfect overlap results in a score of 1, and no overlap results in a score of 0.

Formal Definition
-----------------
Let :math:`A` and :math:`B` be two sets representing the terms in two documents. The **OverlapCoefficient** between :math:`A` and :math:`B` is defined as:

.. math::
    \text{Overlap}(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{\min(|A|, |B|)}

Where:
- :math:`|A \cap B|` is the size of the intersection of the two sets.
- :math:`\min(|A|, |B|)` is the size of the smaller set.

This definition ensures that the similarity score is normalized based on the smaller set's size, making the coefficient a robust measure even for sets of different sizes.

Conclusion
----------
The **OverlapCoefficient** is an effective and simple method to measure similarity between two sets, often used in text mining and document comparison tasks. Its ability to handle sets of varying sizes makes it a useful tool for comparing content in different sized documents or texts.
