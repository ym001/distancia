FeatureBasedDistance
====================

Introduction
------------

The `FeatureBasedDistance` class computes the distance between two images based on their feature descriptors, using various feature extraction techniques such as SIFT, SURF, and ORB. This method of image comparison relies on detecting keypoints and matching feature descriptors, which are unique to the content of the image.

Nature of the Distance
----------------------

Feature-based distance measures the similarity between two images by comparing local features. These features represent keypoints of interest, such as edges or corners, and their associated descriptors. The closer the descriptors between two images, the more similar the images are considered.

Formal Definition
------------------

Given two sets of feature descriptors, \( D_1 = \{d_{1,1}, d_{1,2}, \dots, d_{1,n}\} \) and \( D_2 = \{d_{2,1}, d_{2,2}, \dots, d_{2,m}\} \), the feature-based distance can be defined by matching the descriptors between the two sets. The Euclidean distance between a pair of descriptors \( d_{1,i} \) and \( d_{2,j} \) is given by:

\[
d(d_{1,i}, d_{2,j}) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{N} (d_{1,i,k} - d_{2,j,k})^2}
\]

The total distance between two images is the sum of the best matches between the descriptors of the two images, typically optimized by minimizing the overall descriptor distance.

Conclusion
----------

Feature-based distance offers an effective way to compare images by focusing on their local structures. Using methods like SIFT, SURF, and ORB, this approach provides robust results even in scenarios where the images may be affected by rotation, scale, or illumination changes.
