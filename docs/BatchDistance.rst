Batch Distance
=============

Introduction
------------
The `BatchDistance` class is designed to efficiently compute distances between pairs of points in large datasets. In scenarios where multiple pairs of points need to be evaluated, processing each pair individually can be time-consuming. The `BatchDistance` class addresses this by enabling batch processing of distance computations, improving both speed and resource efficiency.

Idea and Utility
----------------
In many data analysis tasks, especially those involving large datasets, it becomes essential to calculate the distances between data points. This is a common requirement in clustering algorithms, nearest neighbor searches, and other similarity-based tasks. However, calculating these distances one pair at a time can be inefficient, particularly when dealing with massive datasets or when real-time processing is required.

The `BatchDistance` class allows users to perform these calculations in batches, which can significantly reduce the computational overhead. By leveraging batch processing, the `BatchDistance` class not only speeds up the computation but also makes the process more scalable. This is particularly useful in fields like machine learning, bioinformatics, and geographic information systems (GIS), where large datasets are frequently encountered.

Usage Example
-------------
Here's a brief example of how to use the `BatchDistance` class:

.. code-block:: python

   points_a = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
   points_b = [(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7)]
   batch_dist = BatchDistance(points_a, points_b, metric='manhattan')
   distances = batch_dist.compute_batch()
   print(distances)

.. code-block:: bash

  >>>[2, 2, 2]

In this example, the `BatchDistance` class computes the Manhattan distances between corresponding pairs of points in `points_a` and `points_b`.

Conclusion
----------
The `BatchDistance` class is a powerful tool for efficiently computing distances in large datasets. By processing distances in batches, this class enables more scalable and faster computations, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners working with large-scale data. The ability to select different distance metrics further enhances its flexibility and utility in a wide range of applications.
