MFCCProcessor
=============

Introduction
------------
The **MFCCProcessor** class is designed to compute the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), a widely used feature in speech and audio signal processing. MFCCs capture the spectral characteristics of a sound by simulating the human ear's response to different frequencies, making them a powerful tool for comparing audio signals in various applications such as speech recognition, music analysis, and sound classification.

Sense of the Distance
---------------------
The distance calculated using MFCCs aims to measure the dissimilarity between two audio signals based on their cepstral representation. By evaluating how closely the spectral properties of two signals match, the MFCC distance provides an objective measure of similarity, making it particularly useful in tasks involving audio signal comparison.

Formal Representation
----------------------
The MFCC calculation involves the following steps:
1. Apply a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the signal to obtain its frequency representation.
2. Use a Mel filterbank to transform the frequency scale into the Mel scale, which mimics human perception of sound.
3. Take the logarithm of the Mel-scaled spectrogram to simulate the human ear's sensitivity to loudness.
4. Finally, apply the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to compress the resulting data into a small set of coefficients (MFCCs).

Given two sets of MFCC vectors, the distance between them can be computed using a variety of distance metrics such as Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping (DTW) to account for temporal misalignments.

Conclusion
----------
The **MFCCProcessor** class provides an efficient way to extract and compare MFCCs from audio signals, making it a versatile tool in the analysis of audio data. By simulating the human ear's perception of sound, this method allows for meaningful comparisons between signals in various applications such as speech recognition, music retrieval, and audio classification.
