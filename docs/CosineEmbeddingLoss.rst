Introduction
------------

Cosine Embedding Loss represents an advanced probabilistic distance measure specifically designed to optimize the angular similarity between feature representations in complex time series data. This sophisticated metric provides a robust mechanism for learning meaningful embeddings by leveraging the directional characteristics of high-dimensional vector spaces.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cosine Embedding Loss methodology is characterized by:

- Precise measurement of angular distance between vector representations
- Optimization of embedding spaces based on directional similarity
- Intelligent handling of high-dimensional probabilistic distributions
- Robust performance across diverse time series representations

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For paired samples x1 and x2 with similarity label y âˆˆ {-1, 1}, Cosine Embedding Loss is mathematically defined as:

.. math::

   L_{cosine}(x_1, x_2, y) = \begin{cases} 
   \max(0, \cos(x_1, x_2)) & \text{if } y = 1 \\
   \max(0, \delta - \cos(x_1, x_2)) & \text{if } y = -1
   \end{cases}

Where:

- :math:`\cos(x_1, x_2)` represents the cosine similarity between samples
- :math:`y` indicates sample similarity (1: similar, -1: dissimilar)
- :math:`\delta` is a margin hyperparameter
- :math:`\max(0, \cdot)` ensures non-negative loss values

Key Mathematical Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Invariant to vector magnitude
