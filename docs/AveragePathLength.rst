Average Path Length Distance
===================================

Introduction
-----------
Average Path Length Distance is a graph similarity metric that compares networks based on their mean shortest path lengths. This measure provides insight into the typical separation between nodes and characterizes the overall efficiency of information flow or transport through the network. It is particularly useful for analyzing the global structure and efficiency of different networks.

Formal Definition
---------------
For two graphs G1 and G2, the average path length distance is defined using:

Let L(G) be the average path length of graph G, calculated as:
L(G) = (1 / (n(n-1))) ∑ d(u,v)

where:
* n is the number of nodes
* d(u,v) is the shortest path length between nodes u and v
* The sum is taken over all pairs of nodes

The distance is then defined as:
D(G1, G2) = |L(G1) - L(G2)|

For disconnected graphs, only the largest connected component is typically considered, or a modified version accounting for infinite paths is used.

Intuition and Significance
------------------------
This metric captures:
* Network efficiency differences
* Variations in typical node separation
* Global connectivity patterns
* Information or transport flow characteristics

Applications
-----------
Average Path Length Distance finds applications in various domains:

1. Information Networks
   * Analyzing data transfer efficiency
   * Comparing network architectures
   * Evaluating routing strategies

2. Social Networks
   * Studying degrees of separation
   * Analyzing information diffusion
   * Measuring social cohesion

3. Biological Networks
   * Comparing metabolic pathways
   * Analyzing neural networks
   * Studying protein interaction networks

Usage Example
------------
```python
from distancia import AveragePathLengthDistance

# Create example graphs
G1 = nx.Graph()
G1.add_edges_from([
    (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
])  # Line graph

G2 = nx.Graph()
G2.add_edges_from([
    (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (0,4)
])  # Cycle graph

# Calculate average path length distance
apl_calculator = AveragePathLengthDistance()
distance = apl_calculator.compute(G1, G2)
print(f"Average Path Length Distance: {distance}")
```

Computational Complexity
----------------------
The computational complexity for comparing two graphs:
* Time complexity: O(|V|(|E| + |V|log|V|)) using Dijkstra's algorithm
* Space complexity: O(|V|²) for storing distance matrix
* For unweighted graphs using BFS: O(|V|(|V| + |E|))

where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges.

Conclusion
---------
Average Path Length Distance provides a robust way to compare networks based on their typical separation characteristics. While computationally demanding for large networks, it offers valuable insights into global network efficiency and structure.

Key strengths of this metric:
* Captures global network efficiency
* Reflects typical node separation
* Indicates information flow capacity
* Useful for comparing network architectures

Best practices for usage:
* Consider the largest connected component for disconnected graphs
* Combine with other metrics for comprehensive comparison
* Account for network size differences when comparing
* Use appropriate modifications for weighted networks

The measure is most effective when used as part of a suite of distance metrics, as it may miss local structural differences while capturing global characteristics.
