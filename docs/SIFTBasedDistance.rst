SIFT-Based Distance
==================

Introduction
-----------
The SIFT-Based distance measure is an advanced computer vision technique that quantifies the similarity between two images by leveraging the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. This measure is particularly valuable when comparing images that may differ in scale, rotation, or translation, making it robust for real-world applications where perfect image alignment cannot be guaranteed.

Understanding the Measure
------------------------
The SIFT-Based distance operates by identifying and matching distinctive keypoints between two images. Each keypoint is described by a 128-dimensional feature vector that captures local image properties in a way that is invariant to various transformations. The distance between two images is then derived from the quality and quantity of matched keypoints.

Formal Definition
---------------
Given two images I₁ and I₂, the SIFT-Based distance D(I₁, I₂) is computed as follows:

1. Extract SIFT keypoints and descriptors from both images:
   K₁, D₁ = SIFT(I₁)
   K₂, D₂ = SIFT(I₂)

2. Find matches between descriptor sets using k-nearest neighbors:
   M = kNN(D₁, D₂)

3. Apply ratio test to filter good matches:
   G = {m ∈ M | dist(m₁) / dist(m₂) < threshold}

4. Calculate final distance score:
   D(I₁, I₂) = 1 - |G| / min(|K₁|, |K₂|)

Where:
- |G| is the number of good matches
- |K₁|, |K₂| are the number of keypoints in each image
- threshold is typically set to 0.75

Application
----------
This distance measure is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
- Image retrieval systems
- Object recognition
- Scene matching
- Image alignment
- Visual localization

Usage Example
------------
.. code-block:: python

    from distancia import SIFTDistance
    
    # Initialize the distance measure
    sift_distance = SIFTDistance()
    
    # Load two images
    image1 = load_image("path/to/image1.jpg")
    image2 = load_image("path/to/image2.jpg")
    
    # Calculate distance
    distance = sift_distance.calculate(image1, image2)
    
    # Print result
    print(f"SIFT-Based distance between images: {distance}")
    # Output: SIFT-Based distance between images: 0.342

Computational Complexity
----------------------
The computational complexity of the SIFT-Based distance measure can be broken down into several components:

- SIFT keypoint detection and descriptor computation: O(n log n) where n is the number of pixels
- Descriptor matching: O(k log k) where k is the number of keypoints
- Overall complexity: O(n log n + k log k)

Memory complexity is O(k) where k is the number of keypoints detected.

Conclusion
---------
The SIFT-Based distance measure provides a robust and reliable way to compare images while being invariant to common image transformations. Its ability to handle real-world variations in scale, rotation, and illumination makes it particularly valuable for practical applications. While computationally more intensive than simpler pixel-based measures, the additional complexity is often justified by its superior matching capabilities and reliability.
