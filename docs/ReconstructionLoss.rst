Reconstruction Loss for Probabilistic Time Series Analysis
===========================================================

Introduction
------------

Reconstruction Loss represents a critical probabilistic distance measure central to autoencoder architectures and representation learning. This sophisticated metric provides a principled approach to evaluating the fidelity of data reconstructions by quantifying the divergence between original input and machine-generated representations.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Reconstruction Loss methodology is characterized by:

- Precise measurement of data representation quality
- Quantification of information preservation during encoding-decoding processes
- Intelligent assessment of feature extraction and reconstruction capabilities
- Robust handling of complex probabilistic distributions

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an input time series x and its reconstructed representation xÌ‚, Reconstruction Loss is mathematically defined across multiple variant formulations:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) Formulation:

.. math::

   L_{MSE}(x, \hat{x}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Formulation:

.. math::

   L_{MAE}(x, \hat{x}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - \hat{x}_i|

3. Cross-Entropy Formulation:

.. math::

   L_{CE}(x, \hat{x}) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} [x_i \log(\hat{x}_i) + (1-x_i)\log(1-\hat{x}_i)]

Where:
- :math:`x` represents the original input time series
- :math:`\hat{x}` represents the reconstructed time series
- :math:`n` denotes the dimensionality of the time series

Key Mathematical Characteristics
