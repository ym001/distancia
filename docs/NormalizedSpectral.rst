NormalizedSpectral Class
=========================

Introduction
------------

The **NormalizedSpectral** class provides a robust method for measuring the distance between two matrices by focusing on their normalized spectral properties. This approach is particularly useful when comparing matrices of varying scales or when eigenvalue magnitudes need to be normalized for meaningful comparisons. Normalized spectral distances are widely applicable in scenarios where structural properties of systems represented by matrices are of primary interest.

Utility
-------

The **NormalizedSpectral** distance is utilized in diverse domains, including:

- **Graph Analysis**: Comparing graphs through their normalized Laplacian spectra.
- **Physics**: Analyzing normalized state-space dynamics in quantum systems.
- **Data Analysis**: Comparing normalized covariance or correlation matrices for datasets with differing variances.
- **Machine Learning**: Assessing the structural similarity of learned feature spaces in models.

By normalizing the eigenvalues before comparison, this method ensures that the distance is scale-invariant, focusing on the inherent structure of the matrices.

Formal Definition
-----------------

Given two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the normalized spectral distance is computed as:

\[
d_{\text{normalized\_spectral}}(A, B) = \| \frac{\lambda(A)}{\|\lambda(A)\|} - \frac{\lambda(B)}{\|\lambda(B)\|} \|_p
\]

Where:

- \( \lambda(A) \) and \( \lambda(B) \) are the eigenvalues of \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
- \( \|\lambda(A)\| \) is the norm of the eigenvalue vector \( \lambda(A) \), typically the Euclidean norm.
- \( \| \cdot \|_p \) is the \( p \)-norm used to measure the difference between the normalized eigenvalue distributions.

This normalization ensures that the eigenvalue distributions are scale-independent, highlighting differences in shape and structure rather than magnitude.

Conclusion
----------

The **NormalizedSpectral** class offers a mathematically principled way to compare matrices based on their normalized spectral characteristics. Its scale-invariant nature makes it a powerful tool for comparing systems with varying magnitudes but similar structural properties. Researchers and practitioners can leverage this class to uncover deeper relationships in graphs, datasets, and models.
