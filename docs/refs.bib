abstract = {The purpose of this research is to study the methods of measuring the similarity of documents and tell us which is the most suitable for Indonesian Scientific Writing. This research method used was Jaro-Winkler Distance as method. Jaro-Winkler is a method that calculates the distance between strings and then measures the similarity. Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) is a method that aims to represent documents in vector form for comparison with the machine learning process. The results of this study compare the results of plagiarism detection between the Jaro-Winkler Distance method and the Doc2Vec method. The best measurement comparison method used is the accuracy of the comparison of documents and their speed. Using the dataset created, Doc2Vec outperformed the Jaro-Winkler Distance algorithm in comparing document similarities. Therefore, the development of a document similarity method will be easier in the future by using Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) in Indonesian scientific works.}

abstract = {The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) is a diagnosis and forecasting method employing Mahalanobis Distance (MD) and Taguchi’s Robust Engineering in a multidimensional system. In MTS, MD is used to construct a continuous measurement scale to discriminate observations and measure the level of abnormality of abnormal observations which compared to a group of normal observations. Therefore, MTS can handle the class imbalance problem. In addition, MTS is unique in its robustness to assess variability among all the levels of observations (noise) and evaluate significant and insignificant features which contributed to the multidimensional system by means of simplistic yet robust technique via Orthogonal Arrays (OA) and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). However, compared with the classic multivariate methods, MTS has a weaker theoretical basis. In order to promote the development and improvement of MTS theory, this paper reviews the literature related to developing and improving MTS theory. The survey presents and analyzes the research results in terms of MD, SNR, Mahalanobis Space (MS), feature selection, threshold, multi-class MTS, and comparison with other methods. Finally, a detailed analysis of the future possible research directions will be proposed to develop and improve MTS.}

abstract="In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.",
