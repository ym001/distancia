                    for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn such
                    representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector
                    to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large
                    vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based
                    on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated
                    to each character n-gram; words being represented
                    as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train
                    models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations
                    for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word
                    representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy
                    tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we
                    show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.}",

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local co-occurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.}

    abstract = "{The frequencies that have been chosen to make up the scale of Western music are geometrically spaced. Thus the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), although extremely efficient in the fast Fourier transform implementation, yields components which do not map efficiently to musical frequencies. This is because the frequency components calculated with the DFT are separated by a constant frequency difference and with a constant resolution. A calculation similar to a discrete Fourier transform but with a constant ratio of center frequency to resolution has been made; this is a constant Q transform and is equivalent to a 1/24‐oct filter bank. Thus there are two frequency components for each musical note so that two adjacent notes in the musical scale played simultaneously can be resolved anywhere in the musical frequency range. This transform against log (frequency) to obtain a constant pattern in the frequency domain for sounds with harmonic frequency components has been plotted. This is compared to the conventional DFT that yields a constant spacing between frequency components. In addition to advantages for resolution, representation with a constant pattern has the advantage that note identification (‘‘note identification’’ rather than the term ‘‘pitch tracking,’’ which is widely used in the signal processing community, is being used since the editor has correctly pointed out that ‘‘pitch’’ should be reserved for a perceptual context), instrument recognition, and signal separation can be done elegantly by a straightforward pattern recognition algorithm.}",

abstract = {Energy distance is a statistical distance between the distributions of random vectors, which characterizes equality of distributions. The name energy derives from Newton's gravitational potential energy, and there is an elegant relation to the notion of potential energy between statistical observations. Energy statistics are functions of distances between statistical observations in metric spaces. Thus even if the observations are complex objects, like functions, one can use their real valued nonnegative distances for inference. Theory and application of energy statistics are discussed and illustrated. Finally, we explore the notion of potential and kinetic energy of goodness-of-fit.}

abstract={In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

abstract={In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

This research method used was Jaro-Winkler Distance as method. Jaro-Winkler is a method that calculates the distance between strings and then measures the similarity. Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) is a method that aims to represent documents in vector form for comparison with the machine learning process. The results of this study compare the results of plagiarism detection between the Jaro-Winkler Distance method and the Doc2Vec method. The best measurement comparison method used is the accuracy of the comparison of documents and their speed. Using the dataset created, Doc2Vec outperformed the Jaro-Winkler Distance algorithm in comparing document similarities. Therefore, the development of a document similarity method will be easier in the future by using Doc2Vec (Paragraph Vector) in Indonesian scientific works.}

abstract = {The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) is a diagnosis and forecasting method employing Mahalanobis Distance (MD) and Taguchi’s Robust Engineering in a multidimensional system. In MTS, MD is used to construct a continuous measurement scale to discriminate observations and measure the level of abnormality of abnormal observations which compared to a group of normal observations. Therefore, MTS can handle the class imbalance problem. In addition, MTS is unique in its robustness to assess variability among all the levels of observations (noise) and evaluate significant and insignificant features which contributed to the multidimensional system by means of simplistic yet robust technique via Orthogonal Arrays (OA) and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). However, compared with the classic multivariate methods, MTS has a weaker theoretical basis. In order to promote the development and improvement of MTS theory, this paper reviews the literature related to developing and improving MTS theory. The survey presents and analyzes the research results in terms of MD, SNR, Mahalanobis Space (MS), feature selection, threshold, multi-class MTS, and comparison with other methods. Finally, a detailed analysis of the future possible research directions will be proposed to develop and improve MTS.}

abstract={In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

abstract = {Several authors have suggested that the use of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as a measure of forecast accuracy should be avoided because they argue it treats forecast errors above the actual observation differently from those below this value. To counter this, the use of a symmetric (or modified) MAPE has been proposed. This paper shows that, in its treatment of negative and positive errors, the proposed modification is far from symmetric, particularly where these errors have large absolute values. It also shows that, under some circumstances, a non-monotonic relationship can occur between the symmetric MAPE and the absolute forecast errors.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents many examples of parallel algorithms and studies them under a uniform framework. The chapter explains a parallel algorithm as a collection of independent task modules that can be executed in parallel and that communicate with each other during the execution of the algorithm. The chapter explains the three important attributes of a parallel algorithm and classifies parallel algorithms in terms of these attributes. Three orthogonal dimensions of the space of parallel algorithms: concurrency control, module granularity, and communication geometry. The classification of parallel algorithms corresponds naturally to that of parallel architectures. Algorithms for synchronous parallel computers are considered, where examples of algorithms using various communication geometries are presented. Algorithms for asynchronous parallel computers are also considered in the chapter. A number of techniques dealing with the difficulties arising from the asynchronous behavior of computation and the examples are mainly drawn from results in concurrent database systems. This chapter deals with the basic issues and techniques in designing parallel algorithms for various architectures. The chapter concludes that issues concerning algorithms for synchronous parallel computers are quite different from those for asynchronous parallel computers.},

For polygonal chains P and Q consisting of p and q edges an algorithm of runtime O(pq log(pq)) measuring the Fréchet-distance between P and Q is developed. Then some important variants are considered, namely the Fréchet-distance for closed curves, the nonmonotone Fréchet-distance and a distance function derived from the Fréchet-distance measuring whether P resembles some part of the curve Q. }
