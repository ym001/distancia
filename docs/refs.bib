It is shown that almost all existing methods are open to serious objection, and that no method fully exploits the potentialities of such systems. The desirable properties of a clustering program are examined de novo, and suggestions made for optimum lines of further development.}",

The unidentified input word is compared to the dictionary again, testing each time to see if the words match—assuming one of these errors occurred. During a test run on garbled text, correct identifications were made for over 95 percent of these error types.},
