Markov Chain Distances
======================

Introduction
============
Markov chains are widely used to model stochastic processes where the next state depends only on the current state. Comparing two Markov chains can help us understand differences in their behavior, transition probabilities, and steady-state distributions. The **Distancia** package provides various methods for calculating distances between two Markov chains, each capturing different aspects of their structures and dynamics. These measures are useful in fields like statistical modeling, machine learning, and decision-making processes.

List of Distances Markov Chain Distance
=======================================

**Transition Probability Distances**
------------------------------------

These distances focus on comparing the transition matrices of two Markov chains. They are primarily concerned with how likely it is to move from one state to another in each Markov chain.

1. :doc:`L1`

   - Measures the element-wise difference between the transition matrices of two Markov chains, providing a simple comparison of transition probabilities.

2. :doc:`Kullback-LeiblerDivergence`

   - Compares the transition probabilities by calculating the divergence between probability distributions over transitions in each chain.

3. :doc:`TotalVariation`

   - Measures the maximum difference between transition probabilities, capturing the largest deviation in state transitions between two chains.

**State Distribution Distances**
--------------------------------

These distances evaluate the differences in steady-state or marginal distributions between two Markov chains, helping to capture differences in long-term behavior.

1. :doc:`Steady-StateDistribution`

   - Compares the steady-state distributions of two Markov chains, evaluating the long-term behavior differences.

2. :doc:`Wasserstein`

   - Measures the “cost” of transforming one steady-state distribution into another, capturing the distributional differences between two chains.

3. :doc:`JensenShannonDivergence`

   - Symmetrized version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that compares the steady-state distributions of the two chains.

**Structural Distances**
------------------------

Structural distances assess the overall architecture of the Markov chains, including how the states are connected and whether there are differences in the structure of the state transitions.

1. :doc:`GraphEditDistance`

   - Calculates the minimal number of edits (additions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform the state transition graph of one Markov chain into another.

2. :doc:`Hamming`

   - Compares the state sequences generated by two Markov chains by calculating the number of positions where the sequences differ.

3. :doc:`SpectralDistance`

   - Compares the eigenvalues of the transition matrices, capturing the differences in the dynamics of the chains, such as mixing times and convergence rates.

Conclusion
==========
The **Distancia** package provides an extensive set of tools to compare Markov chains using various distance measures. Whether you're interested in comparing transition probabilities, state distributions, or the overall structure, **Distancia** offers methods tailored to different analysis needs. By understanding these distances, you can gain valuable insights into the behavior of stochastic systems, making **Distancia** a versatile tool for applications ranging from machine learning to operations research.
