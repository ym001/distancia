Chebyshev Distance
===================

The Chebyshev distance, also known as the maximum metric or Lâˆž metric, is a measure of the distance between two points in a space. It is defined as the maximum absolute difference between the coordinates of the points. This metric is particularly useful in situations where movement is allowed only in discrete steps.

Formula
--------

The formula for calculating the Chebyshev distance between two points :math:`\mathbf{p}` and :math:`\mathbf{q}` in an n-dimensional space is given by:

.. math::

    d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = \max_{i} \left| p_i - q_i \right|

Where:

- :math:`\mathbf{p}` and :math:`\mathbf{q}` are two points in n-dimensional space.

- :math:`p_i` and :math:`q_i` are the coordinates of the points in the i-th dimension.

- :math:`\left| p_i - q_i \right|` is the absolute difference between the coordinates.

History
--------

The Chebyshev distance is named after the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who contributed significantly to the field of mathematical analysis and approximation theory. The metric itself was introduced in the mid-19th century as part of Chebyshev's work on polynomial approximation.

Unlike Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance between two points, the Chebyshev distance measures the maximum difference along any coordinate dimension. This metric is particularly useful in grid-based environments such as chessboards, where the distance between two points is determined by the maximum number of steps required along any axis.

Example Usage
-------------

Here is a Python example demonstrating how to calculate the Chebyshev distance between two points using the `distancia` package:

```python
from distancia import Chebyshev

# Define the coordinates of the two points
point1 = (1, 3, 4)
point2 = (4, 7, 1)

# Create an instance of ChebyshevDistance
chebyshev = ChebyshevDistance()

# Calculate the Chebyshev distance
distance = chebyshev.distance(point1, point2)

print(f"Chebyshev Distance: {distance}")
