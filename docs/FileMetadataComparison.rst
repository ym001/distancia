FileMetadataComparison
=======================

Introduction
------------
The **FileMetadataComparison** class compares two files based on their metadata attributes such as file size, creation date, modification date, and permissions. This approach focuses on structural aspects of files rather than their contents, offering a lightweight and efficient way to compare files, especially in contexts where metadata changes are significant.

Distance Meaning
----------------
This distance measures the degree of difference between the metadata of two files. Files with similar metadata, such as creation times, sizes, and permissions, will have a smaller distance, while files with significant differences in their attributes will have a larger distance. This approach is particularly useful when the content remains unchanged, but the metadata is modified.

Formal Definition
-----------------
Let `F1` and `F2` be two files. The **FileMetadataComparison** distance `D(F1, F2)` is computed by comparing a set of metadata attributes for both files:

.. math::

   D(F1, F2) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot d_i(M_i(F1), M_i(F2))

Where:
- `M_i` represents the metadata attribute (e.g., file size, creation date, permissions).
- `d_i` is the difference between the attribute values of `F1` and `F2` for the metadata type `M_i`.
- `w_i` is a weight representing the importance of each metadata attribute in the overall comparison.

Conclusion
----------
The **FileMetadataComparison** class offers an efficient method to compare files based on their metadata attributes. This technique is ideal for scenarios where content comparison is not feasible or necessary, but differences in attributes like file size, permissions, or timestamps are important. This approach is commonly used in file synchronization, backup systems, and forensic analysis to detect changes in file properties without needing to access the file's contents.
