===========================================================

Introduction
------------

Wasserstein Loss represents a sophisticated probabilistic distance measure that has revolutionized the field of generative modeling, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This advanced metric provides a robust mechanism for measuring the distance between probability distributions, offering unprecedented stability and precision in complex time series generation and analysis.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Wasserstein Loss methodology distinguishes itself through:

- Precise measurement of optimal transport between probability distributions
- Providing a mathematically rigorous distance metric
- Enabling stable training of generative models
- Capturing intricate probabilistic variations

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Wasserstein-1 (Earth Mover's) Distance is mathematically defined as:

.. math::

   W(P, Q) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P,Q)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\gamma}\left[\|x - y\|\right]

Where:

- :math:`P, Q` represent probability distributions
- :math:`\Pi(P,Q)` denotes the set of joint distributions
- :math:`\mathbb{E}` represents the expected value
- :math:`\|x - y\|` represents the distance between points

Loss Formulation for Generative Models:

.. math::

   L_{Wasserstein} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P_{data}}[f(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P_{model}}[f(x)]

Key Mathematical Characteristics
