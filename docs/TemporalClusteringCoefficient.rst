Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance
==================================

Introduction
-----------
The Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance is a measure that compares how clustering patterns evolve over time in dynamic networks. This measure extends the traditional clustering coefficient to temporal networks by considering time-stamped interactions and evaluating how triadic closures develop through time. It is particularly useful for understanding the evolution of local cohesiveness in dynamic social networks, communication patterns, and collaborative systems.

Mathematical Foundation
--------------------
The temporal clustering coefficient distance between two temporal graphs G₁(V₁, E₁, T₁) and G₂(V₂, E₂, T₂) is based on comparing their temporal clustering patterns. For a temporal graph G, the temporal clustering coefficient C(t) at time t is defined as:

    C(t) = (number of closed triangles at t) / (number of connected triples at t)

The temporal clustering distance is then computed as:

    d(G₁, G₂) = ∑_t |C₁(t) - C₂(t)| / |T|

where:
- C₁(t) and C₂(t) are the clustering coefficients at time t
- |T| is the number of time steps

For a node i, its temporal clustering coefficient at time t is:

    C_i(t) = |{(j,k): e_ij(t'), e_jk(t''), e_ki(t''') exist, t' ≤ t'' ≤ t''' ≤ t}| /
              |{(j,k): e_ij(t'), e_jk(t'') exist, t' ≤ t'' ≤ t}|

Application
----------
The Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance is particularly useful for:
- Analyzing the evolution of social communities
- Studying information diffusion patterns
- Evaluating temporal network formation processes
- Detecting anomalies in network evolution
- Understanding collaboration dynamics
- Analyzing communication network patterns

Usage Example
------------
Here's how to use the Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance measure in the distancia package:

```python
from distancia import TemporalClusteringDistance
import networkx as nx

# Create two temporal graphs using lists of (node1, node2, timestamp) edges
edges1 = [
    (0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 0, 3),  # Forms a triangle over time
    (3, 4, 2), (4, 5, 3), (5, 3, 4)
]
edges2 = [
    (0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 0, 4),  # Similar triangle, different timing
    (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (5, 3, 3)
]

# Initialize the distance measure
tcc_distance = TemporalClusteringDistance()

# Calculate the distance between the two temporal graphs
distance = tcc_distance.compute(edges1, edges2)
print(f"Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance: {distance}")

# Optional: Get clustering coefficients for specific timestamps
t = 3
clustering1 = tcc_distance.get_clustering_coefficient(edges1, t)
clustering2 = tcc_distance.get_clustering_coefficient(edges2, t)
```

Computational Complexity
----------------------
The computational complexity involves several components:
- Building temporal adjacency matrices: O(|E|)
- Computing clustering coefficients per timestamp: O(|V| × ∆²), where ∆ is the maximum degree
- Total complexity: O(|T| × |V| × ∆²)

Optimizations:
- Incremental triangle counting for streaming data
- Parallel computation across time windows
- Approximate methods for large-scale networks
- Efficient data structures for temporal triangle tracking

Conclusion
---------
The Temporal Clustering Coefficient Distance provides a sophisticated way to compare the evolution of local structure in temporal networks. By extending the classical clustering coefficient to the temporal domain, it captures important aspects of network dynamics such as the formation and dissolution of triangles over time. While computationally more demanding than static measures, various optimizations make it practical for real-world applications. This measure is particularly valuable for understanding how local network structure evolves in dynamic systems, from social networks to communication patterns, where the timing of interactions plays a crucial role in system behavior.
