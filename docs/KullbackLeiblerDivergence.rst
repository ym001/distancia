Kullback-Leibler Divergence for Probabilistic Time Series Analysis
===========================================================

Introduction
------------

Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence represents a fundamental probabilistic distance measure that quantifies the information-theoretic difference between two probability distributions. This sophisticated metric provides a critical tool for understanding how one probability distribution diverges from a reference distribution, offering profound insights into probabilistic time series analysis.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KL Divergence methodology characterizes probabilistic divergence through:

- Measuring the information loss when approximating one distribution with another
- Providing an asymmetric measure of distributional difference
- Capturing the relative entropy between probability distributions

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For discrete probability distributions P and Q, KL Divergence is mathematically defined as:

.. math::

   D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log\left(\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\right)

For continuous probability distributions, the formula extends to:

.. math::

   D_{KL}(P || Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx

Where:

- :math:`P(i)` or :math:`p(x)` represents the probability of event i in distribution P
- :math:`Q(i)` or :math:`q(x)` represents the probability of event i in distribution Q
- :math:`\log()` denotes the natural logarithm

Mathematical Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fundamentally non-symmetric (:math:`D_{KL}(P || Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q || P)`)
- Always non-negative
- Zero if and only if the distributions are identical
- Sensitive to divergences in low-probability regions

Computational Complexity
-----------------------

Time Complexity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **O(n)**: Linear computational complexity
- Efficient processing of probabilistic distributions
- Minimal algorithmic overhead

Space Complexity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **O(n)**: Linear memory requirements
- Proportional to the size of input distributions
- Scalable across diverse dataset dimensions
