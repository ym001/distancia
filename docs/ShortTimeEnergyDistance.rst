Short-Time Energy Distance: Analyzing Temporal Energy Patterns in Audio
=======================================================================

Introduction
------------

The Short-Time Energy (STE) Distance is a crucial audio signal processing technique used to quantify variations in energy patterns of sound over time. This class, part of the `distancia` Python package, provides an efficient implementation for calculating and comparing the short-time energy of audio signals, offering valuable insights into their temporal energy characteristics.

Significance of the Measure
---------------------------

STE Distance is essential for:

- Detecting voice activity in speech processing
- Distinguishing between voiced and unvoiced speech segments
- Analyzing music onset detection and beat tracking
- Identifying silence regions in audio streams
- Evaluating audio signal dynamics and loudness variations

The STE Distance helps capture the time-varying nature of audio energy, making it particularly useful for applications that require temporal analysis of sound intensity.

Formal Definition
-----------------

The Short-Time Energy for a discrete-time signal x[n] is defined as:

.. math::

   E[m] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} (x[n]w[mR-n])^2

Where:
- E[m] is the short-time energy for the m-th frame
- w[n] is the window function
- R is the hop size between successive frames

The STE Distance between two signals can then be computed as the Euclidean distance between their STE values:

.. math::

   D_{STE} = \sqrt{\sum_{m=1}^{M} (E_1[m] - E_2[m])^2}

Where E_1[m] and E_2[m] are the STE values for the two signals being compared.

Complexity Estimation
---------------------

The time complexity of the STE Distance calculation is O(N + M), where:
- N is the total number of samples in the audio signals
- M is the number of frames

This includes:
- O(N) for computing the STE for each signal
- O(M) for calculating the Euclidean distance between STE values

The space complexity is O(M) for storing the STE values of each frame.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from distancia import ShortTimeEnergyDistance

   # Initialize with two audio signals
   signal1 = [0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.3, ...]  # Your first signal here
   signal2 = [0.2, 0.1, -0.2, 0.4, ...]  # Your second signal here
   ste_distance = ShortTimeEnergyDistance(frame_size=1024, hop_size=512)
   
   # Calculate the STE Distance
   distance = ste_distance.calculate(signal1, signal2)
   
   print(f"The Short-Time Energy Distance between the signals is: {distance}")

Conclusion
----------

The Short-Time Energy Distance class in the `distancia` package offers a powerful tool for analyzing temporal energy patterns in audio signals. Its implementation provides high precision and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from speech processing to music analysis.
