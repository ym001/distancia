HashComparison
===============

Introduction
------------
The **HashComparison** class provides a method to compare two files or data objects by calculating and comparing their hash values. Hash functions generate a fixed-size output from variable input data, making them suitable for verifying data integrity and detecting changes between files.

Distance Meaning
----------------
In **HashComparison**, the distance is binary: either the two hash values match (indicating the files are identical) or they do not match (indicating some difference in the files). Hash-based comparison is particularly useful in large-scale systems for quick data verification and detecting modifications.

Formal Definition
-----------------
Given two files or objects, let `H(A)` and `H(B)` represent the hash values of `A` and `B`, respectively:

.. math::

   D(A, B) =
   \begin{cases}
   0, & \text{if } H(A) = H(B) \\
   1, & \text{if } H(A) \neq H(B)
   \end{cases}

Where `H(A)` and `H(B)` are the results of a hash function (e.g., SHA-256, MD5) applied to files `A` and `B`. The distance `D(A, B)` is binary: 0 for equality, 1 for inequality.

Conclusion
----------
The **HashComparison** method is an efficient and widely used approach for determining whether two files or data streams are identical or have been modified. Its utility in data integrity checks, file version control, and security applications makes it an essential tool for ensuring consistency and authenticity across systems. By reducing files to hash values, it allows for fast and reliable comparison without examining the entire data contents.
