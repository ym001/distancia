ByteLevelDistance
=================

Introduction
------------
The **ByteLevelDistance** measures the dissimilarity between two files or data streams by comparing them at the byte level. This distance is particularly useful when comparing binary data, such as files, where character-level comparisons are not appropriate. It can be applied in contexts such as file integrity verification, malware analysis, or data compression.

Distance Meaning
----------------
Byte-level comparison operates on the raw binary representation of two inputs. This approach allows the detection of differences that occur at the lowest level of the data structure, making it suitable for binary files or encoded data. It measures how different two data streams are by evaluating the individual byte sequences.

Formal Definition
-----------------
Given two byte sequences, let `A` and `B` represent two files or streams:

.. math::

   D(A, B) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |A_i - B_i|

Where `n` is the length of the shorter byte sequence, `A_i` and `B_i` represent the bytes at position `i` in sequences `A` and `B`, respectively, and `D(A, B)` is the byte-level distance between `A` and `B`.

Conclusion
----------
The **ByteLevelDistance** is a robust method for detecting low-level changes between two binary data sources. Its precision makes it suitable for applications requiring fine-grained comparison, such as digital forensics, file similarity detection, and binary data analysis. This metric is highly adaptable to any context where raw byte-by-byte comparison is necessary, offering a detailed level of granularity in detecting differences between two data sets.
