Introduction
------------

The ``Percolation`` class represents an innovative computational approach to measuring distances between matrices through the lens of percolation theory. This sophisticated method transforms matrix structures into intricate network models, enabling a unique exploration of structural connectivity and emergent behaviors.

Utility of the Distance
-----------------------

The percolation-based matrix distance offers several critical advantages:

- **Structural Connectivity Analysis**: Evaluates matrix similarities through dynamic network propagation
- **Phase Transition Insights**: Captures critical points of structural transformation
- **Multidisciplinary Relevance**: Applicable in complex systems research, network science, and computational physics

Formal Definition
-----------------

For a matrix A of dimensions n×n, the percolation distance is defined as:

.. math::

    PercolationDistance(A, B) = \left|\theta_{A} - \theta_{B}\right|

Where:
- :math:`\theta_{A}` represents the percolation threshold of matrix A
- :math:`\theta_{B}` represents the percolation threshold of matrix B
- The threshold :math:`\theta` is the critical probability at which a spanning cluster emerges

Percolation Threshold Calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The percolation threshold is determined through an iterative process:

1. Generate a random graph representation of the matrix
2. Progressively activate network connections
3. Identify the critical probability where a giant component emerges
4. Compute the spanning probability

Computational Complexity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Monte Carlo simulation iterations
- Probabilistic convergence mechanism

Theoretical Foundations
