DynamicBinaryInstrumentation
=============================

Introduction
------------
The **DynamicBinaryInstrumentation** class measures the difference in runtime behavior between two executable files by analyzing their execution flow through dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI). DBI is a technique that involves monitoring and modifying the execution of a program at runtime to collect execution traces, system calls, and control flow data, which can be used to compare how two binaries behave during execution.

Distance Meaning
----------------
This distance measures the divergence in the execution profiles of two executables, such as differences in system calls, memory access patterns, and control flow. Executables with similar functionality but different implementations may exhibit smaller distances, while binaries with different behavior will have a larger distance.

Formal Definition
-----------------
Let `E1` and `E2` be two executable files. During their execution, we collect system call traces, control flow graphs (CFG), and memory access patterns. The **DynamicBinaryInstrumentation** distance `D(E1, E2)` can be computed by comparing these execution profiles using various metrics such as:

.. math::

   D(E1, E2) = f(\text{SysCalls}(E1, E2), \text{CFG}(E1, E2), \text{MemoryAccess}(E1, E2))

Where `SysCalls`, `CFG`, and `MemoryAccess` represent the differences in system calls, control flow graphs, and memory usage between `E1` and `E2`, respectively.

Conclusion
----------
The **DynamicBinaryInstrumentation** class provides a robust method to compare executables based on their runtime behavior. By capturing differences in execution flow, memory access, and system calls, this approach is useful for tasks such as malware analysis, performance profiling, and identifying functional discrepancies between different binary versions or implementations. This method allows for a deep analysis of behavior at the binary level, offering a detailed understanding of program differences beyond static code analysis.
