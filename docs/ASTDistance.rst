ASTDistance: Measuring Differences in Abstract Syntax Trees
===========================================================

Introduction
------------

The **ASTDistance** class is a Python-based tool designed to compare the syntactic structure of two code files by analyzing their Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). An AST represents the hierarchical structure of source code, capturing its syntax and logical flow in a tree-like format. By comparing ASTs, this class provides a precise method for identifying differences in code structure, making it useful for tasks such as plagiarism detection, refactoring analysis, and software similarity evaluation.

Sense of the Formula
--------------------

The distance metric measures the structural dissimilarity between two ASTs. Each AST node represents a syntactic element such as variables, operators, or control flow constructs. Differences between two ASTs can arise from:

- Variations in the number or type of nodes.
- Changes in the relationships between nodes (e.g., parent-child relationships).
- Modifications in specific attributes like variable names or constant values.

This approach focuses on the structural essence of code, ignoring superficial differences like comments or formatting.

Formal Definition
-----------------

Let \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) represent the ASTs of two code files. Each AST is a directed acyclic graph where:

- Nodes represent syntactic elements.
- Edges represent hierarchical relationships.

The distance \( d(A_1, A_2) \) can be defined using a tree edit distance algorithm:

\[
d(A_1, A_2) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \cdot f_i(A_1, A_2)
\]

Where:
- \( f_i(A_1, A_2) \): The cost of transforming \( A_1 \) into \( A_2 \) using operations such as insertion, deletion, or substitution of nodes.
- \( c_i \): The cost weight for each operation.

A common implementation uses algorithms like Zhang-Shasha's tree edit distance to compute \( d(A_1, A_2) \).

Complexity
----------

The computational complexity of comparing two ASTs depends on the chosen algorithm:
- **Tree Edit Distance:** For Zhang-Shasha's algorithm, the complexity is \( O(n^3) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the larger tree.
- **Optimized Approaches:** Heuristics or approximations can reduce complexity to \( O(n^2) \) or better for specific cases.

In practice, pre-processing steps like pruning irrelevant nodes or normalizing identifiers can significantly improve performance.

Conclusion
----------

The **ASTDistance** class offers a robust mechanism for comparing code files by analyzing their syntactic structures. Its ability to capture structural differences makes it an essential tool for developers and researchers working on software analysis, plagiarism detection, and automated code review. By leveraging formal tree comparison algorithms and efficient implementations, this class provides actionable insights into code similarity and evolution.
