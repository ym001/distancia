# ResNet-Based Distance Measure

## Introduction

The ResNet-Based distance measure is an advanced method for computing similarities between images using the deep features extracted from the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture. This approach leverages the power of residual learning to capture complex image features at multiple levels of abstraction, providing a robust and sophisticated measure of image similarity that is particularly effective for complex visual scenes.

## Mathematical Foundation

The ResNet-Based distance measure operates on the principle of deep feature extraction followed by distance computation in the resulting feature space.

For two input images I₁ and I₂, the distance is defined as:

D(I₁, I₂) = d(R(I₁), R(I₂))

Where:
- R(·) is the feature extraction function using ResNet
- d(·,·) represents the chosen distance metric
- R(I) ∈ ℝᵐ, where m is the dimension of the feature space
- The final feature vector is typically extracted from the penultimate layer

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these key steps:

1. Image Preprocessing:
   - Resize images to 224×224 pixels (standard ResNet input size)
   - Normalize using ImageNet statistics (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
   - Convert to tensor format

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Forward pass through ResNet architecture
   - Extract features from the selected layer
   - Apply L2 normalization if required

3. Distance Computation:
   - Calculate distance between normalized feature vectors

## Usage Example

```python
from distancia import ResNetDistance

# Initialize with desired configuration
resnet_distance = ResNetDistance(
    model_depth=50,  # ResNet-50 by default
    metric='cosine'
)

# Compare single pair of images
distance = resnet_distance.compute(image1_path, image2_path)

# Batch computation
distances = resnet_distance.compute_batch(
    images_list,
    batch_size=32
)
```

## Computational Complexity

The algorithm's complexity can be analyzed in three parts:

1. Feature Extraction: O(L×N), where:
   - L is the number of layers
   - N is the number of parameters per layer

2. Distance Computation: O(D), where:
   - D is the dimension of the feature vectors

3. Memory Requirements:
   - O(B×D) for batch processing
   - B is the batch size
   - D is the feature dimension

## Advantages

1. Deep Feature Representation:
   - Captures hierarchical features through residual connections
   - Robust to various image transformations
   - Effective for both low-level and high-level features

2. Scalability:

   - Memory intensive for large batches

2. Model Selection:
   - Trade-off between depth and computational cost
   - Different variants may be optimal for different domains

## Conclusion

The ResNet-Based distance measure provides a powerful tool for image comparison by leveraging the deep learning capabilities of residual networks. Its ability to capture complex hierarchical features makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring detailed image understanding. While computationally intensive, the measure offers excellent performance across a wide range of image comparison tasks, especially when dealing with complex visual scenes or subtle differences between images.
