Huber Loss for Probabilistic Time Series Distance Measurement
===========================================================

Introduction
------------

Huber Loss represents a sophisticated probabilistic distance measure that offers a robust approach to comparing probability distributions across time series. By seamlessly integrating mean squared error and mean absolute error principles, this metric provides enhanced resilience to outliers and extreme variations.

Theoretical Foundations
----------------------

Formula Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Huber Loss methodology creates a hybrid loss function that:

- Demonstrates quadratic behavior for small probabilistic deviations
- Transitions to linear error representation for significant divergences
- Mitigates the impact of extreme probabilistic outliers

Formal Mathematical Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a probability distribution P and Q, the generalized Huber Loss is defined as:

.. math::

   H(P, Q) = \begin{cases} 
   0.5 * \int(p(x) - q(x))^2 dx & \text{if } |P - Q| \leq \delta \\
   \delta * |P - Q| - 0.5 * \delta^2 & \text{if } |P - Q| > \delta
   \end{cases}

Where:

- :math:`p(x)` represents the probability density of distribution P
- :math:`q(x)` represents the probability density of distribution Q
- :math:`\delta` is a hyperparameter controlling error transition
- :math:`\int` denotes the integral across the entire distribution

Computational Complexity
-----------------------

Time Complexity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **O(n log n)**: Distribution comparison requires integral computation
- Scaling proportional to distribution sample size
- Efficient for moderate to large probabilistic datasets

Space Complexity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **O(n)**: Linear memory requirement relative to input dimensions
- Requires storage of distribution parameters

Implementation Considerations
