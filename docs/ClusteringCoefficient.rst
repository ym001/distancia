Clustering Coefficient Distance
===================================

Introduction
-----------
Clustering Coefficient Distance is a graph similarity metric that compares networks based on their tendency to form tightly knit groups. The clustering coefficient measures the degree to which nodes cluster together, reflecting the presence of triangles and local density in networks. This distance metric is particularly valuable for comparing social structures, biological networks, and other systems where local connectivity patterns are significant.

Formal Definition
---------------
For two graphs G1 and G2, the clustering coefficient distance uses the global clustering coefficient C(G):

Let C(G) be the global clustering coefficient:
C(G) = (3 × number of triangles) / (number of connected triples)

Alternatively, using the local clustering coefficient:
C(G) = (1/n) ∑ Ci

where Ci = (number of triangles connected to node i) / (number of triples centered on node i)

The distance is then defined as:
D(G1, G2) = |C(G1) - C(G2)|

Intuition and Significance
------------------------
This metric captures:
* Differences in local connectivity patterns
* Variations in network transitivity
* Community structure differences
* Local density variations

Applications
-----------
Clustering Coefficient Distance is valuable in various domains:

1. Social Network Analysis
   * Comparing friendship network structures
   * Analyzing community formation
   * Studying information diffusion patterns

2. Biological Networks
   * Comparing protein interaction networks
   * Analyzing metabolic networks
   * Studying neural connectivity

3. Technological Networks
   * Analyzing computer network topology
   * Studying web graph structure
   * Evaluating communication networks

Usage Example
------------
```python
from distancia import ClusteringCoefficientDistance

# Create example graphs
G1 = nx.Graph()
G1.add_edges_from([
    (0,1), (1,2), (2,0),  # Triangle
    (2,3), (3,4)          # Path
])

G2 = nx.Graph()
G2.add_edges_from([
    (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)  # Path
])

# Calculate clustering coefficient distance
cc_calculator = ClusteringCoefficientDistance()
distance = cc_calculator.compute(G1, G2)
print(f"Clustering Coefficient Distance: {distance}")
```

Computational Complexity
----------------------
The computational complexity for comparing two graphs:
* Time complexity: O(|V|Δ²) where Δ is the maximum degree
* For sparse graphs: O(|E|)
* Space complexity: O(1) for the global coefficient
* For local coefficients: O(|V|) to store individual values

Conclusion
---------
Clustering Coefficient Distance provides a powerful way to compare networks based on their local connectivity patterns and community structure. This metric is particularly effective for:
* Identifying differences in local network organization
* Comparing community formation tendencies
* Analyzing network evolution
* Studying social and biological system similarities

Key considerations:
* Works best for networks of similar size and density
* May need normalization for networks of different sizes
* Consider both global and local coefficients
* Effective for detecting hierarchical structure differences

Best practices include:
* Using weighted versions for weighted networks
* Combining with other metrics for comprehensive comparison
* Considering size effects in interpretation
* Accounting for network density in analysis

For most applications, this metric should be used as part of a suite of distance measures, as it primarily captures local structural properties rather than global network characteristics.
