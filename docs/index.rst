   :caption: Example 1: Calculating Euclidean Distance


   from distancia import Euclidean

   point1 = [1, 2, 3]
   point2 = [4, 5, 6]

   # Create an instance of Euclidean
   euclidean = Euclidean()

   # Calculate the Euclidean distance
   distance = euclidean.compute(point1, point2)

   print(f"Euclidean Distance: {distance.:4f}")

.. code-block:: bash

   >>>Euclidean Distance: 5.196




.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example 2: Calculating Levenshtein Distance

   from distancia import Levenshtein
