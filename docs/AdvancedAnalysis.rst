AdvancedAnalysis
================

Introduction
------------
The `AdvancedAnalysis` class is designed to perform in-depth analysis on distance metrics, with a focus on robustness, sensitivity, and consistency. This class offers advanced tools for examining how distance metrics respond to perturbations in data, noise, and other factors that may affect their performance. It is particularly useful in applications requiring high reliability and understanding of the metric’s behavior under various conditions, such as outlier detection, noise handling, and consistency across subsets of data.

The goal of the `AdvancedAnalysis` class is to provide a robust framework for testing and validating distance metrics beyond simple evaluations, ensuring that metrics are well-suited for complex, real-world data environments.

Formal Analysis of Distance Properties
--------------------------------------
Let \( D(x, y) \) be a distance metric that measures the dissimilarity between data points \( x \) and \( y \). The `AdvancedAnalysis` class provides several formal tools to assess the behavior of this metric under various conditions:

1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Given a dataset \( X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \} \), the sensitivity of the metric is analyzed by applying small perturbations \( \epsilon \) to the dataset and measuring the change in the computed distances \( D(x_i, x_j) \).
   
.. math::

   \text{Sensitivity}(D) = \frac{\partial D(x_i, x_j)}{\partial \epsilon}
   

2. **Robustness Analysis**: The metric’s robustness is evaluated by introducing different levels of noise \( \eta \) into the dataset and observing its effect on the distance computation.

.. math::

   D_\eta(x, y) = D(x, y) + \eta
   

3. **Entropy of Distances**: The entropy or information content of the distance distribution can be computed to evaluate the variability and unpredictability in the dataset. The entropy \( H \) is defined as:

.. math::

   H(D) = - \sum P(D(x_i, x_j)) \log P(D(x_i, x_j))
   

4. **Consistency Check Over Subsets**: This checks whether the metric yields consistent results when applied to different subsets of the data \( S_1 \subset X, S_2 \subset X \). Consistency is measured by comparing the distance distributions between the subsets.

.. math::

   \text{Consistency}(D) = \frac{D(S_1)}{D(S_2)}
   

Significance of the Analysis
----------------------------
The advanced analyses provided by this class are essential for evaluating the practical applicability of a distance metric in various real-world scenarios. Sensitivity analysis helps ensure that the metric is stable and not overly affected by small changes in the data, which is critical for applications such as anomaly detection and machine learning models where data may contain noise or outliers.

Robustness analysis further tests the metric's performance under noisy conditions, which is especially important in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, or biological data where imperfect data is common. Entropy of distances offers insight into the distribution and diversity of the dataset, helping to determine if the metric is capturing meaningful distinctions between data points.

Consistency checks validate whether the metric behaves uniformly across different portions of the dataset, ensuring it remains reliable when applied to subsets.
