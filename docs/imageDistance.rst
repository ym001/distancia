Image-Based Distances in Distancia
====================================

Introduction
============

The **distancia** package offers a comprehensive set of methods for comparing images using various distance metrics. These image-based distances can be used for tasks such as image retrieval, similarity searches, clustering, and object recognition. Each method provides a unique way to quantify the similarity or difference between images, whether based on pixel values, histograms, or more complex structural and feature-based approaches.

In this document, we categorize the image distance metrics available in **distancia** and provide brief descriptions of each method.

Categories of Image-Based Distances
===================================

Pixel-Based Distances
=====================
  
  1. :doc:`Euclidean`  
   
  Measures the straight-line distance between two images by treating them as high-dimensional vectors of pixel values. It is useful for comparing images with similar alignment and size.

  2. :doc:`Manhattan`

   Also known as the "taxicab" distance, this metric sums the absolute differences of the pixel values between two images. It's robust to small variations in pixel values.

  3. :doc:`Chebyshev` 
   Measures the greatest difference between pixel values of two images across any dimension. It emphasizes the maximum change in intensity rather than the overall sum of changes.

  4. :doc:`Minkowski`
   A generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, it offers flexibility by allowing different levels of emphasis on small or large differences between pixel values.

Histogram-Based Distances
=========================

1. :doc:`HistogramIntersection`
   Compares two images by computing the intersection of their color histograms. This method focuses on how many pixel colors overlap between the two images.

2. :doc:`Chi-Square`
   A distance metric commonly used to compare image histograms by measuring the difference between the distributions of pixel intensities in two images.

3. :doc:`Bhattacharyya`
   Measures the similarity between two image histograms by calculating the overlap between their probability distributions. It is often used in object recognition tasks.

4. :doc:`Kullback-Leibler`  
   A measure of how one probability distribution (histogram) differs from another, capturing the amount of information lost when one histogram is used to approximate another.

Feature-Based Distances
=======================

1. :doc:`SIFT-Based`
   Uses the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect and compare keypoints and descriptors in two images, providing robustness to scale, rotation, and translation differences.

2. :doc:`SURF-Based`
   Similar to SIFT but faster, SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) is used to extract and compare distinctive points between two images, particularly useful for object recognition tasks.

3. :doc:`ORB-Based`
   ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is an efficient alternative to SIFT and SURF, focusing on matching image keypoints and descriptors. It is fast and well-suited for real-time applications.

Structural and Transform-Based Distances
========================================

1. :doc:`StructuralSimilarityIndex`
   Measures the structural similarity between two images, focusing on luminance, contrast, and structure. It provides a perceptually meaningful comparison.

2. :doc:`FourierTransform`
   Compares images in the frequency domain using their Fourier transforms. This distance is particularly useful for comparing images based on global patterns and periodic structures.

3. :doc:`WaveletTransform`
   Measures the difference between two images after decomposing them into their wavelet components. Wavelet-based methods are effective for capturing local image details at multiple scales.

Deep Learning-Based Distances
=============================

1. :doc:`VGG16-Based`  
   Uses the VGG16 deep convolutional neural network to extract high-level features from images and computes the distance between these feature representations. Suitable for high-level content comparison.

2. :doc:`Inception-Based`
   Employs the Inception architecture to extract feature vectors from images and compares them using a chosen distance metric. It is effective for capturing complex features in images.

3. :doc:`ResNet-Based`
   Utilizes the ResNet architecture to compare the deep features of images, enabling robust comparison of complex, high-dimensional image representations.

Compression-Based Distances
===========================

1. :doc:`NormalizedCompressionDistance`
   Measures the similarity between two images by comparing the compression of the images concatenated together with their individual compressions. It captures the redundancy and shared information between images.

2. :doc:`Zlib-Based`
   A variant of compression-based distance that uses the zlib algorithm to compare images based on their compressibility, reflecting how much the structure of two images is alike.

Conclusion
==========

The **distancia** package provides a broad selection of image distance metrics, allowing for flexible and tailored comparison of images based on a variety of featuresâ€”ranging from pixel intensities to deep learning representations. Whether you are working on object recognition, image retrieval, or similarity detection, **distancia** offers the right tools to measure distance in ways that match your specific requirements.
